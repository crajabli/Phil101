        <h2>what is philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            it is without doubt the knowledge of death and along with this the consideatiion of life's
            suffering and hardshiop that provies the strongest impetus to philosophical reflextion and
            metaphyscial explantions of the world
            -Arthur Schopenhauer
        </p>
        <p>
            in times of rapid changes when society is neither normal nor settled, the average person
            is driven to thinking about things beyond the round of life- things that would uphold this essential round,
            and suddenly seem insecure; providence and its plan,
            the credentials of human authoritites, the valididty of morals and instututions the value or vanity of work
            and the life itself - Susanne Langer
            "Round of Life" - common sense "intellectual machinery of our daily living"
        </p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Our Most Basic Beliefs</h3>
            <li>Hold up our everyday thougts, ideas, doubts, & judgments</li>
            <li>composed of concepts and in turn compose worldviews</li>
            <ul><li>Worldview</li>
                <li>System of basic beliefs, background assumptions</li>
                <li>helps make experiences & perceptions appear coherent to us</li>
                <li>frames how we look at this, guides our actions & choices</li>
            </ul>
            <li>often unrecognized; usually only dimly aware of them</li>
            <li>acquired uncricitacally through others(e.g. family, peers, society)</li>
            <li>we get into the habit of libing, instead of thinking and getting into the living?</li>
            <li>basis f our emotional security</li>
        </ul>
        <p> philosophical consequences
            page 15 wall says
            we may have believed that our self is our soul. If we come to see that it seems
            unreasonable to accept such a belief it may nevertheless be difficult to for us
            to revise it and alter our worldbiew that may have depened so much on its being true - Wall

            philosophical courage
            page 16 wall
            some poeople have this type of courage while others are called back to confort back to the
            securty of believing what others have decided for them is true - Wall


            page 6
            It involves quiestioning the most basic beliefs that each of us accepts about ourselves and the universe.
            this means your philosophical journey sometimes may lead you in directions that
            society does not support toward views that others around you reject - Vasquez

            undersntanding the point of livingnot just living
            -is what Socrates finds valuable. It is liverating in the truest sense
            that its study frees us to understnad oursleves and thus allows us to begin to create who we are - Wall page 9
